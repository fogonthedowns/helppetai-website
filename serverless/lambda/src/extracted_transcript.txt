I'm trying to uh create a 15 2nd timer to see if the skip thing works. Maybe I'll make this a 30-second thing. Um, this is for Winston from iPhone. Uh, Winston is a golden retriever male, 4 years old, born July 27th, 2021. He is in good condition. He has ear mites or ear funk, trying to figure out what that is. Does skip work? Trying to determine if skip works. It's 32 seconds now. Let's see if skip works.
