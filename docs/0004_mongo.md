HelpPet is a mobile/web app designed as a unified platform for pet health management, connecting pet owners with veterinary practices. It allows owners to track their pets' medical histories across multiple vets (e.g., primary, specialists, or emergency clinics), while enabling practices to access shared records for better continuity of care. The core value proposition is seamless, default sharing of pet dataâ€”eliminating silos and providing a complete, aggregated history (including visit transcripts) that no single practice might have alone.

For the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), the focus is on simplicity and core functionality using MongoDB for the backend:



App Data Model for HelpPet (MongoDB MVP)



Collections below show sample document structures.
1. users Collection
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"username": "john_doe",
"email": "john@example.com",
"password_hash": "hashed_value",
"role": "PetOwner",
"full_name": "John Doe",
"practice_id": null  // ObjectId for staff, null for owners
}
2. veterinaryPractices Collection
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"name": "Paws & Claws Vet",
"admin_user_id": ObjectId("...")
}
3. petOwners Collection
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"user_id": ObjectId("..."),
"emergency_contact": "555-1234"
}
4. pets Collection
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"name": "Fluffy",
"species": "Dog",
"breed": "Labrador",
"age": 5,
"gender": "Male",
"owner_id": ObjectId("...")
}
5. petPracticeAssociations Collection
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"pet_id": ObjectId("..."),
"practice_id": ObjectId("...")
}
// Simple join; add associations as needed for multiple practices.
6. medicalRecords Collection
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"pet_id": ObjectId("..."),
"version": 1,
"content": { "vaccinations": ["rabies"], "conditions": ["none"] },  // JSON for flexibility
"updated_by": ObjectId("..."),
"updated_at": ISODate("2023-10-01T12:00:00Z")
}
// Snapshots: Add new docs with incremented version for changes. Query all by pet_id, sort by version.
7. visits Collection
{
"_id": ObjectId("..."),
"pet_id": ObjectId("..."),
"practice_id": ObjectId("..."),
"vet_user_id": ObjectId("..."),
"visit_date": ISODate("2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"),
"audio_transcript": "Transcript text here..."
}
// Transcripts shared by default: Any associated practice can query visits by pet_id (even if practice_id differs, for full history across practices).
Implementation Notes

Adding Data: Use Mongo inserts. E.g., to associate a pet with a practice: Insert into petPracticeAssociations.
Querying Full History: For a vet at practice X viewing pet Y:

Verify association: db.petPracticeAssociations.find({ pet_id: Y, practice_id: X }).
If exists, get history: db.medicalRecords.find({ pet_id: Y }).sort({ version: -1 }) and db.visits.find({ pet_id: Y }).sort({ visit_date: -1 }).
This aggregates transcripts and records from all visits, regardless of practice_id, providing the unique full history.


Indexes: Add for performance, e.g., on pet_id in medicalRecords/visits, and compound on pet_id + practice_id in petPracticeAssociations.
Scalability: Starts simple; if histories grow, shard by pet_id.
App Logic: In code (e.g., Node.js with MongoDB driver), enforce role-based access (e.g., owners see all, vets only associated pets).

This keeps it MVP-simple while enabling default sharing for transcripts and records. If you need sample code or further adjustments, let me know!
