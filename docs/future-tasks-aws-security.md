# Future Tasks: AWS Security & Infrastructure Improvements

## High Priority Security Tasks

### 1. Replace Hardcoded AWS Credentials with IAM Roles
**Current State:** Using `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables in ECS
**Target State:** Use ECS Task IAM Role for S3 access

**Benefits:**
- No credentials in environment variables
- Automatic credential rotation
- Better security posture
- Easier credential management

**Implementation:**
1. Create IAM role with S3 bucket permissions
2. Attach role to ECS task definition
3. Remove AWS credential environment variables
4. Update S3 client to use default credential chain

### 2. S3 Bucket Security Hardening
**Current State:** Basic S3 bucket with minimal configuration
**Target State:** Production-ready S3 bucket with security best practices

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Enable S3 bucket encryption at rest
- [ ] Configure bucket policy for least privilege access
- [ ] Enable S3 access logging
- [ ] Configure lifecycle policies for cost optimization
- [ ] Enable versioning for data protection

### 3. Network Security Improvements
**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review VPC security groups for least privilege
- [ ] Implement VPC endpoints for S3 (avoid internet routing)
- [ ] Add WAF protection for ALB
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail for API auditing

### 4. Secrets Management
**Current State:** JWT secrets and DB passwords in environment variables
**Target State:** Use AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store

**Benefits:**
- Automatic secret rotation
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit trail for secret access
- Integration with ECS for seamless injection

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 5. Infrastructure as Code
- [ ] Convert manual AWS resource creation to CloudFormation/CDK
- [ ] Version control infrastructure changes
- [ ] Implement proper resource tagging strategy

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch dashboards for application metrics
- [ ] Configure alerts for error rates, latency, resource usage
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing with X-Ray

### 7. Backup & Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Automated RDS backups with point-in-time recovery
- [ ] S3 cross-region replication for audio files
- [ ] Document disaster recovery procedures

## Implementation Timeline

**Sprint 1 (Next 2 weeks):**
- IAM roles for ECS tasks
- S3 bucket encryption and policies

**Sprint 2 (Following 2 weeks):**
- Secrets Manager integration
- CloudWatch monitoring setup

**Sprint 3 (Month 2):**
- Infrastructure as Code
- Backup/DR procedures

**Note:** These improvements should be prioritized based on business needs and compliance requirements. The current MVP approach is acceptable for initial launch but should be addressed for production scaling.
