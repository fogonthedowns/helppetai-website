would the ultimate fix be to use unix time stamps? One real problem is this is voice input, so I will only ever get a tmz 9pm some date as input. I must ALWAYS be able to translate.

That’s exactly the core of the problem: you’re mixing human-facing “wall clock” times with storage/lookup times.

Let’s ground this:

✅ What “ultimate fix” looks like

Store everything in UTC in the DB

Availability slots should be stored as full UTC timestamps (not separate date and time fields).

If a vet is available “2025-10-03 at 9 PM America/Los_Angeles”, convert that once at insert time into UTC:

2025-10-04 04:00:00+00


and store that.

Queries become dead simple: no phantom shifts.

Keep the user’s intent in local time

Voice input is always “9 PM some date in <tz>”.

Parse it as a timezone-aware local datetime (2025-10-03 21:00 in America/Los_Angeles).

Convert to UTC before comparing with DB.

Translate back for display

When presenting results, always convert the UTC slots back into the practice/user’s timezone before speaking them.

❌ Why your current model is brittle

date + start_time without tz means you’re guessing.

Sometimes you interpret them as UTC, sometimes as local. That’s why you’re seeing phantom shifts and rejections.

Midnight (00:00:00) is especially problematic — is that “end of today” or “start of tomorrow”?

🕰️ Why Unix timestamps are a good fix

Yes — storing as Unix timestamps (or full TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE in Postgres) is the ultimate fix:

They are unambiguous UTC moments in time.

Easy to compare, sort, and range-query in SQL.

Easy to translate into any timezone for voice input/output.

Unix timestamps are just integers, but in practice Postgres’ timestamptz is easier — it stores UTC internally and handles timezone conversion.

🔑 Practical design

DB schema

-- Best: replace date + start_time + end_time with this
start_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
end_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL


Insert flow (voice input → local datetime → UTC → DB):

local = tz.localize(datetime(2025, 10, 3, 21, 0))
utc = local.astimezone(pytz.UTC)
# store utc in DB


Query flow (DB UTC → local datetime → human):

utc_dt = row.start_at  # tz-aware UTC datetime from Postgres
local_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(tz)
say(f"{local_dt.strftime('%-I:%M %p')} on {local_dt.strftime('%A, %B %d')}")


👉 So yes: the ultimate fix is to normalize all slots to UTC (via Unix timestamps or timestamptz) and only convert at boundaries (input + output).

Want me to sketch how you’d migrate your current date + time schema into a proper timestamptz-based schema without breaking existing data?

You said:
can we use unix time stamp? for 1?

Yes — Unix timestamps are the ultimate canonical form you should use to represent appointments internally.

Here’s why it works for your case (voice input like “Oct 3rd, 9pm PST”):

Parse the natural language input

Voice → text gives you "Oct 3, 9pm PST".

Use a parser (e.g. dateutil.parser, pytz, or zoneinfo) to interpret the local date/time and time zone.

Result: a timezone-aware datetime.

from dateutil import parser
from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo

dt = parser.parse("Oct 3, 2025 9pm").replace(tzinfo=ZoneInfo("America/Los_Angeles"))


Convert to Unix timestamp (UTC seconds since 1970)

Store this as the single source of truth.

unix_ts = int(dt.timestamp())


Translate to any time zone on demand

When showing to a vet in EST or a client in PST, you just localize:

from datetime import datetime

# vet in EST
est = datetime.fromtimestamp(unix_ts, ZoneInfo("America/New_York"))

# client in PST
pst = datetime.fromtimestamp(unix_ts, ZoneInfo("America/Los_Angeles"))


🔑 Rule of thumb:

Store in UTC (Unix timestamp).

Display in local time zones.

Always attach a time zone when parsing human input, or you risk ambiguity.
