Dr. Smith: Hello, I'm examining Buddy today. He's a 3-year-old Golden Retriever.
Owner: He's been limping on his front right paw for about a week.
Dr. Smith: I can see some swelling in the paw. Let me examine it more closely.
The pad looks irritated, possibly from a cut or foreign object.
I'm going to clean the wound and apply an antibiotic ointment.
Owner: Should I be worried?
Dr. Smith: It's a minor injury. Keep the paw clean and dry. 
Come back in a week if it doesn't improve. I'll prescribe some antibiotics as a precaution.
