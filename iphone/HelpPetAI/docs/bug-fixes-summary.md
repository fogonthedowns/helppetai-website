# Bug Fixes Summary - HelpPetAI iOS App

## Issues Fixed

### 🗓️ **Bug #1: App Shows Old Appointments Instead of Today's Date**

**Problem:** The app was displaying appointments from September 1, 2025, regardless of the current date.

**Root Cause:** Hard-coded test date in `APIManager.swift` line 198:
```swift
let testDate = date ?? "2025-09-01"  // ❌ Hard-coded test date
```

**Solution:** Dynamic date calculation using current date:
```swift
let actualDate = date ?? {
    let formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd"
    formatter.timeZone = TimeZone.current
    return formatter.string(from: Date())
}()
```

**Files Changed:**
- `HelpPetAI/Services/APIManager.swift` - Lines 197-202

**Result:** ✅ App now correctly shows today's appointments based on the current date

### ⏱️ **Bug #2: Recording Timer Persists Between Different Pets**

**Problem:** After recording for one pet, the next pet's recording timer would start at 4 seconds instead of 00:00.

**Root Cause:** `AudioManager.shared` is a singleton, so the `recordingDuration` state persisted between recording sessions for different pets.

**Solution:** Added state reset functionality:

1. **New Reset Method in AudioManager:**
```swift
func resetRecordingState() {
    recordingDuration = 0
    isRecording = false
    isPlaying = false
    stopTimer()
    audioRecorder = nil
    currentRecordingId = nil
}
```

2. **Reset on Recording Start:**
```swift
func startRecording(appointmentId: String, visitId: String? = nil) async throws -> URL? {
    // Reset any previous recording state
    await MainActor.run {
        self.resetRecordingState()
    }
    // ... rest of recording logic
}
```

3. **Reset on View Appearance:**
```swift
.onAppear {
    // Reset recording state when view appears for new pet
    audioManager.resetRecordingState()
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `HelpPetAI/Services/AudioManager.swift` - Lines 57-59, 357-364
- `HelpPetAI/Models/Views/AudioRecordingView.swift` - Lines 197-200

**Result:** ✅ Each pet's recording session now starts with a fresh timer at 00:00

## Testing Verification

### Date Fix Testing:
1. **Check Dashboard API Call:** Verify the API request URL includes today's date
2. **Appointment Display:** Confirm only today's appointments are shown
3. **Date Changes:** Test that appointments update correctly when the date changes (e.g., at midnight)

### Timer Fix Testing:
1. **Single Pet Recording:** Timer should start at 00:00 and count up normally
2. **Multi-Pet Scenario:**
   - Record for Pet A (e.g., 10 seconds) → Upload → Complete
   - Open recording for Pet B → Timer should start at 00:00 (not 10 seconds)
   - Record for Pet B → Timer counts from 00:00
3. **View Navigation:** Dismissing and reopening recording view should reset timer

## Implementation Details

### Date Fix Architecture:
```
User Opens App → Dashboard loads → APIManager.getTodaySchedule() 
→ Current date calculated → API called with today's date
→ Backend returns today's appointments → UI displays current schedule
```

### Timer Reset Architecture:
```
User selects Pet A → AudioRecordingView appears → resetRecordingState() called
→ Timer starts at 00:00 → Recording proceeds normally
→ User completes/cancels → Returns to appointment view
→ User selects Pet B → AudioRecordingView appears → resetRecordingState() called
→ Timer starts fresh at 00:00 (not persisting from Pet A)
```

## Performance Impact

- **Date Fix:** Minimal - Only adds a date formatter calculation once per dashboard load
- **Timer Fix:** Minimal - Reset operation is lightweight and only called when needed

## Backward Compatibility

- **Date Fix:** Maintains the optional `date` parameter for testing/debugging purposes
- **Timer Fix:** Doesn't break existing recording functionality, only improves state management

## Future Considerations

### Date Handling:
- Consider timezone handling for practices operating across time zones
- Add date picker for viewing appointments on different dates
- Cache today's appointments to reduce API calls

### Recording State:
- Consider per-pet recording history/state if needed
- Add recording session analytics
- Implement recording draft/resume functionality

## Summary

Both bugs are now **RESOLVED** ✅

1. **Date Issue:** App correctly displays today's appointments instead of hard-coded test data
2. **Timer Issue:** Recording timer properly resets to 00:00 for each new pet recording session

The fixes are minimal, targeted, and maintain backward compatibility while resolving the core user experience issues reported.
